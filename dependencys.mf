## Usage Instructions

### Swift Projects

- **Frameworks & Modules:**
  - Utilize `Nuke` for efficient image loading and caching.
  - Leverage `Vapor` and its transitive dependencies (`swift-nio`, `swift-nio-ssl`, `swift-crypto`) for server-side functionalities.
  - Implement `SWCompression` and `BitByteData` for archive handling.
  - Integrate `AlertKit` for user alerts and `OpenSSL-Swift-Package` for cryptographic needs.
  - Use `MobileCoreServices` for UTI handling where necessary.

### Custom Language / Terminal Development

For building and extending the custom language features:

- The model should **search for relevant open-source code on the web** to assist in the implementation.
- If web access is restricted or the code is not found, **the model will automatically download necessary codebases directly into your workspace** to facilitate development.

---

## Important Notes

- When developing the custom language features, leverage open-source repositories and download the open source code directly into your workspace if external web access is not working or is limited.
