# Task 6: Debugger Module Enhancement

## Overview
Perform a deep analysis of the debugger module and enhance it to be a production-grade component with robust features, improved UI, and comprehensive debugging capabilities.

## General Guidelines
- **Production-Level Code**: Provide complete, robust, production-ready code. Avoid stub code, partial implementations, or simplified logic. Ensure all code is functional, adheres to real-world logic, and follows best practices.
- **Real Files Only**: Use existing files in the codebase. Do not create placeholder files. Access necessary files to ensure successful compilation and execution.
- **No Simplified Code**: Remove any previously added simplified code and replace with complete, production-ready implementations reflecting real functionality.
- **Issue Resolution**: Address each issue sequentially, providing a complete fix before proceeding.
- **Repository Analysis**: Thoroughly examine every file in the codebase. Base changes on a comprehensive understanding of the codebase.
- **Dependencies**: Utilize dependencies listed in `dependencies.md` to enhance functionality and ensure compatibility.
- **Critical Examination**: Evaluate logic critically, ensuring implementations are logical, efficient, and secure.

## Specific Requirements
