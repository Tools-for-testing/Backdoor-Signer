# Task 2: Terminal Enhancement and On-Device Implementation

## Overview
Identify the terminal implementation within the codebase and all connected components. Remove reliance on external websites for terminal functionality and implement a fully on-device terminal tailored to the application's needs.

## General Guidelines
- **Production-Level Code**: Provide complete, robust, production-ready code. Avoid stub code, partial implementations, or simplified logic. Ensure all code is functional, adheres to real-world logic, and follows best practices.
- **Real Files Only**: Use existing files in the codebase. Do not create placeholder files. Access necessary files to ensure successful compilation and execution.
- **No Simplified Code**: Remove any previously added simplified code and replace with complete, production-ready implementations reflecting real functionality.
- **Issue Resolution**: Address each issue sequentially, providing a complete fix before proceeding.
- **Repository Analysis**: Thoroughly examine every file in the codebase. Base changes on a comprehensive understanding of the codebase.
- **Dependencies**: Utilize dependencies listed in `dependencies.md` to enhance functionality and ensure compatibility.
- **Critical Examination**: Evaluate logic critically, ensuring implementations are logical, efficient, and secure.

## Specific Requirements

### Terminal Independence
- Remove all external website dependencies for the terminal functionality
- Implement a complete, on-device terminal with app-specific functionality
- Ensure all terminal operations work without internet connectivity

### Feature Enhancement
- Enhance the terminal with additional features using open-source tools listed in `dependencies.md`
- Add support for command history, auto-completion, and syntax highlighting
- Implement robust error handling and reporting

### Code Quality
- Ensure all logic is production-grade and free of placeholder code
- Optimize for performance and responsiveness
- Implement proper memory management and resource handling

### UI/UX Improvements
- Enhance the terminal interface for better usability
- Provide clear visual feedback for command execution
- Ensure accessibility standards are met

### Integration
- Ensure seamless integration with the custom programming language from Task 1
- Maintain compatibility with existing terminal functionality
- Verify all terminal commands work correctly in the new implementation

## Implementation Steps

1. Locate the terminal implementation
   - Identify all files related to the terminal functionality
   - Analyze how terminal connections are currently managed
   - Document the existing API and feature set

2. Identify and remove external API calls or website dependencies
   - Look for URL connections, WebSocket implementations, or remote API calls
   - Remove dependencies on external servers or services
   - Replace with local equivalents for all functionality

3. Develop a new on-device terminal using Swift and relevant dependencies
   - Implement a process management system for command execution
   - Create a terminal emulation layer if necessary
   - Use standard Unix/Linux command execution for shell commands

4. Add enhanced features to the terminal
   - Implement command history with persistence
   - Add syntax highlighting for better readability
   - Include error reporting with meaningful messages
   - Support for auto-completion and command suggestions

5. Ensure compatibility with the custom language
   - Integrate with the execution engine from Task 1
   - Support language switching and interoperability
   - Maintain consistent state across command executions

6. Test thoroughly to ensure compatibility and stability
   - Verify all commands work as expected
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Ensure performance is acceptable under various loads

## Expected Deliverables
- Fully on-device terminal implementation with no external dependencies
- Enhanced terminal with improved features and user experience
- Complete integration with the custom programming language
- Documentation of the terminal's capabilities and commands

## Notes
- The terminal should maintain all existing functionality while adding new features
- Performance is critical for terminal operations
- Consider adding visual improvements to make the terminal more user-friendly
- Ensure secure execution of commands, especially when accessing system resources
