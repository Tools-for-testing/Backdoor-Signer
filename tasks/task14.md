# Task 14: Delegates Folder Enhancement

## Overview
Enhance all code in the `delegates` folder to be production-grade and fully implemented. This task involves upgrading delegate implementations to ensure they are complete, efficient, and follow best practices for iOS development.

## General Guidelines
- **Production-Level Code**: Provide complete, robust, production-ready code. Avoid stub code, partial implementations, or simplified logic. Ensure all code is functional, adheres to real-world logic, and follows best practices.
- **Real Files Only**: Use existing files in the codebase. Do not create placeholder files. Access necessary files to ensure successful compilation and execution.
- **No Simplified Code**: Remove any previously added simplified code and replace with complete, production-ready implementations reflecting real functionality.
- **Issue Resolution**: Address each issue sequentially, providing a complete fix before proceeding.
- **Repository Analysis**: Thoroughly examine every file in the codebase. Base changes on a comprehensive understanding of the codebase.
- **Dependencies**: Utilize dependencies listed in `dependencies.md` to enhance functionality and ensure compatibility.
- **Critical Examination**: Evaluate logic critically, ensuring implementations are logical, efficient, and secure.

## Specific Requirements

### Code Analysis
- Review all files in the `delegates` folder
- Identify incomplete, placeholder, or simplified implementations
- Document delegate patterns and responsibilities
- Understand how delegates integrate with the rest of the application

### Implementation Completion
- Complete any partial or placeholder delegate implementations
- Ensure all delegate methods have proper implementations
- Add missing functionality to fulfill delegate responsibilities
- Implement robust error handling and edge case management

### Delegate Design Improvements
- Enhance delegate protocols for better clarity and usability
- Apply proper delegation patterns and practices
- Implement weak references to prevent retain cycles
- Create clear documentation for delegate usage

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize delegate method implementations for efficiency
- Ensure proper memory management in delegate interactions
- Implement thread safety where appropriate
- Minimize performance impact of delegate callbacks

### Standardization
- Standardize delegate naming and implementation patterns
- Create consistent error handling across delegate implementations
- Normalize callback patterns and parameter passing
- Establish clear ownership and lifecycle management

## Implementation Steps

1. Review delegate protocols and implementations
   - Analyze all delegate files in the folder
   - Document protocol requirements and implementations
   - Identify missing or incomplete methods
   - Note design inconsistencies or issues

2. Complete or enhance logic as needed
   - Implement missing delegate methods
   - Enhance simplistic implementations with robust code
   - Add proper error handling and state validation
   - Ensure all delegate functionality is complete

3. Improve delegate design
   - Refine protocol definitions for clarity
   - Update method signatures for consistency
   - Implement proper weak references for delegates
   - Ensure clear ownership boundaries

4. Optimize performance
   - Review performance-critical delegate methods
   - Implement efficient data passing techniques
   - Ensure proper thread handling for delegate callbacks
   - Minimize redundant operations in delegate methods

5. Standardize implementation patterns
   - Create consistent delegation patterns
   - Normalize naming conventions
   - Standardize error handling approaches
   - Implement uniform lifecycle management

6. Test delegate interactions to confirm correctness
   - Verify delegate method calls and responses
   - Test error conditions and edge cases
   - Confirm proper memory management
   - Validate thread safety in concurrent scenarios

## Expected Deliverables
- Enhanced delegate implementations throughout the `delegates` folder
- Complete implementation of all delegate methods
- Improved delegation patterns and practices
- Documentation of delegate protocols and usage

## Notes
- Pay special attention to retain cycles in delegate relationships
- Consider thread safety for delegates called from background threads
- Ensure clear documentation for delegate protocols and requirements
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing delegate usage
