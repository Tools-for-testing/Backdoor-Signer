# Task 3: Fix App Crash After Initial Screens

## Overview
Resolve the critical issue where the application crashes after passing the initial screens, rendering it unusable until reinstalled. The crash prevents navigation and persists across sessions, creating a significant usability barrier.

## General Guidelines
- **Production-Level Code**: Provide complete, robust, production-ready code. Avoid stub code, partial implementations, or simplified logic. Ensure all code is functional, adheres to real-world logic, and follows best practices.
- **Real Files Only**: Use existing files in the codebase. Do not create placeholder files. Access necessary files to ensure successful compilation and execution.
- **No Simplified Code**: Remove any previously added simplified code and replace with complete, production-ready implementations reflecting real functionality.
- **Issue Resolution**: Address each issue sequentially, providing a complete fix before proceeding.
- **Repository Analysis**: Thoroughly examine every file in the codebase. Base changes on a comprehensive understanding of the codebase.
- **Dependencies**: Utilize dependencies listed in `dependencies.md` to enhance functionality and ensure compatibility.
- **Critical Examination**: Evaluate logic critically, ensuring implementations are logical, efficient, and secure.

## Specific Requirements

### Crash Diagnosis
- Perform a deep analysis of all navigation-related code
- Identify the root cause of the crash through systematic debugging
- Investigate view controller lifecycle management
- Analyze memory management and resource allocation/deallocation
- Check for threading/concurrency issues that may cause crashes

### Comprehensive Fix
- Provide a complete, production-ready fix for the identified issue(s)
- Ensure the fix prevents future crashes and maintains app stability
- Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Document the changes and the reasoning behind them

### Stability Enhancements
- Review initialization sequences for potential issues
- Check for race conditions in app startup
- Verify proper state management across view transitions
- Add defensive programming techniques where appropriate

### Testing and Verification
- Test the fix thoroughly across different scenarios
- Verify that navigation works without crashes in all app sections
- Ensure the fix does not introduce new issues or regressions
- Test app stability across app backgrounding/foregrounding

## Implementation Steps

1. Analyze crash logs and debugger output to pinpoint the issue
   - Examine stack traces to identify where crashes occur
   - Check for memory issues, null pointers, or threading problems
   - Log key state transitions to identify patterns

2. Review navigation stack, view controller lifecycle, and data initialization
   - Analyze how view controllers are created and presented
   - Check for improper memory management or retain cycles
   - Verify that data dependencies are properly initialized

3. Fix the specific issue
   - Address the root cause with proper error handling
   - Implement defensive programming techniques
   - Add proper state validation before critical operations
   - Fix any memory management or threading issues

4. Add crash protection mechanisms
   - Implement recovery mechanisms for potential future issues
   - Add proper error reporting for better diagnostics
   - Ensure graceful degradation rather than hard crashes

5. Test the app thoroughly to confirm navigation works without crashes
   - Verify stability across all navigation paths
   - Test with various user interaction patterns
   - Confirm performance is not negatively impacted

## Expected Deliverables
- Complete fix for the crash issue
- Detailed explanation of the root cause and solution
- Enhanced stability and error handling in navigation code
- Any additional improvements to prevent similar issues

## Notes
- The fix should be as non-invasive as possible while fully addressing the issue
- The solution should follow iOS best practices
- Consider adding telemetry or better logging for future diagnostics
- User experience should remain smooth and consistent after the fix
