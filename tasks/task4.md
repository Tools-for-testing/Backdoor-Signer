# Task 4: Remove Keychain Usage

## Overview
Ensure the application does not use Apple Keychain for data storage. Identify all instances of Keychain usage and replace them with secure local storage alternatives that maintain data integrity and security.

## General Guidelines
- **Production-Level Code**: Provide complete, robust, production-ready code. Avoid stub code, partial implementations, or simplified logic. Ensure all code is functional, adheres to real-world logic, and follows best practices.
- **Real Files Only**: Use existing files in the codebase. Do not create placeholder files. Access necessary files to ensure successful compilation and execution.
- **No Simplified Code**: Remove any previously added simplified code and replace with complete, production-ready implementations reflecting real functionality.
- **Issue Resolution**: Address each issue sequentially, providing a complete fix before proceeding.
- **Repository Analysis**: Thoroughly examine every file in the codebase. Base changes on a comprehensive understanding of the codebase.
- **Dependencies**: Utilize dependencies listed in `dependencies.md` to enhance functionality and ensure compatibility.
- **Critical Examination**: Evaluate logic critically, ensuring implementations are logical, efficient, and secure.

## Specific Requirements

### Keychain Identification
- Identify all Keychain-related code in the application
- Look for Apple Keychain APIs, third-party Keychain wrappers, or libraries
- Document all instances of Keychain usage and their purpose
- Map data types and security requirements for each usage

### Secure Alternative Implementation
- Replace Keychain storage with secure local alternatives
- Implement encryption for sensitive data using libraries from `dependencies.md`
- Ensure all replacements maintain or improve security standards
- Create a consistent API for secure storage operations

### Data Migration
- Create a migration path for existing Keychain data if applicable
- Ensure no data loss during transition to new storage system
- Implement one-time migration code if required for existing installations

### Verification and Testing
- Verify that all functionality works correctly with the new storage mechanism
- Test edge cases like app reinstallation and device restarts
- Confirm that security standards are maintained
- Ensure performance is not significantly impacted

## Implementation Steps

1. Identify all Keychain-related code
   - Search for Keychain APIs and third-party libraries
   - Document purpose and security requirements for each usage
   - Understand data structures and access patterns

2. Design a secure local storage solution
   - Select appropriate encryption mechanisms using `dependencies.md` resources
   - Design a consistent API for secure data operations
   - Ensure proper key management without Keychain dependency

3. Implement local storage using encrypted mechanisms
   - Create secure file storage with proper encryption
   - Implement data integrity validation
   - Add proper error handling and recovery

4. Update all affected code to use the new storage mechanism
   - Replace all Keychain API calls with your new implementation
   - Maintain consistent interface where possible to minimize code changes
   - Update all dependent code to work with the new storage system

5. Add data migration if necessary
   - Create one-time migration code for existing installations
   - Ensure data accessibility across updates
   - Implement fallback mechanisms if migration fails

6. Test data persistence and security
   - Verify all previous functionality works with new storage
   - Test security boundaries and encryption effectiveness
   - Confirm no regressions in functionality or security

## Expected Deliverables
- Complete removal of all Keychain usage
- Implementation of secure local storage alternatives
- Migration path for existing data if applicable
- Documentation of the new secure storage implementation

## Notes
- Security must not be compromised in the transition
- The solution should be efficient in terms of storage and performance
- Consider edge cases like device restarts and app updates
- Use established cryptographic libraries rather than custom implementations
