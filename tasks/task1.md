# Task 1: Custom Programming Language Design and Implementation

## Overview
Design and implement a custom programming language for the application inside the terminal integration. The language must integrate with Python and Swift, providing a seamless programming experience within the terminal environment.

## General Guidelines
- **Production-Level Code**: Provide complete, robust, production-ready code. Avoid stub code, partial implementations, or simplified logic. Ensure all code is functional, adheres to real-world logic, and follows best practices.
- **Real Files Only**: Use existing files in the codebase. Do not create placeholder files. Access necessary files to ensure successful compilation and execution.
- **No Simplified Code**: Remove any previously added simplified code and replace with complete, production-ready implementations reflecting real functionality.
- **Issue Resolution**: Address each issue sequentially, providing a complete fix before proceeding.
- **Repository Analysis**: Thoroughly examine every file in the codebase. Base changes on a comprehensive understanding of the codebase.
- **Dependencies**: Utilize dependencies listed in `dependencies.md` to enhance functionality and ensure compatibility.
- **Critical Examination**: Evaluate logic critically, ensuring implementations are logical, efficient, and secure.

## Specific Requirements

### Python Integration
- Enable writing, executing, and coding in Python
- Support installing Python dependencies, running scripts, and performing Python-related tasks
- Provide access to Python's standard library and ecosystem

### Swift Integration
- Enable writing, executing, and running Swift code
- Include support for command-line tools and native iOS APIs
- Provide full access to Swift's capabilities and language features

### Interoperability
- Allow switching between Python and Swift within the same program
- Support data passing between Python and Swift
- Maintain state and context when switching between languages

### Terminal Enhancement
- Enhance the terminal interface to support the custom language
- Provide a user-friendly environment for code input and execution
- Implement proper error handling and reporting

### Language Features
- Define a clear, user-friendly syntax for the custom language
- Support variables, control flow, and function definitions
- Include language constructs for seamless switching between Python and Swift

### Optimization
- Ensure the implementation is efficient and optimized for iOS
- Implement secure execution environments for both languages
- Note that the application is not subject to App Store restrictions

## Implementation Steps
1. Design the language syntax and create a formal specification
   - Define how language switching works
   - Specify syntax for data passing between languages
   - Document language constructs and features

2. Develop an execution engine to parse and run the custom language
   - Integrate Python and Swift runtimes
   - Implement the parser for the custom language
   - Create an execution context manager for handling state

3. Enhance the terminal interface to support the new language
   - Add syntax highlighting if possible
   - Implement command history for language-specific commands
   - Add auto-completion for common language constructs

4. Use open-source libraries from `dependencies.md` for interoperability
   - Leverage any suitable libraries for language processing
   - Use available tools for Python and Swift integration

5. Provide a complete solution including:
   - Language design documentation
   - Execution engine implementation
   - Terminal UI enhancements
   - Example programs demonstrating language features

## Expected Deliverables
- Full implementation of the custom programming language
- Enhanced terminal interface supporting the new language
- Documentation of language syntax and features
- Example programs demonstrating key capabilities

## Notes
- The language should be intuitive enough for users familiar with either Python or Swift
- Error reporting should be clear and helpful
- Performance is important but secondary to functionality
- Security considerations should be addressed, especially for code execution
