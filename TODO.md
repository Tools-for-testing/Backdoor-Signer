# iOS Executor Dylib and Custom Programming Language Implementation

This document outlines the tasks and requirements for updating an iOS-specific executor dylib project and implementing a custom programming language for a private iOS application. The executor dylib is built exclusively for iPhone using GitHub Actions, and the custom language enhances terminal integration with Python and Swift interoperability. All tasks must adhere to production-grade standards, using real files, complete logic, and iOS-specific optimizations. The codebase includes multiple folders (`anti_detection`, `exec`, `hooks`, `memory`, `security`, `iOS`, `naming_conventions`) and a Lua interpreter file (`interpreter.lua`). The tasks also address specific issues, such as app crashes, UI bugs, and incomplete logic, ensuring high-quality, robust implementations.

## General Guidelines
- **Production-Grade Logic**: All code must be real-world, robust, and optimized for iOS performance. No placeholders, stubs, or incomplete logic. Avoid phrases like “in a real implementation.”
- **iOS Exclusivity**: The dylib and application are built for iOS (iPhone) only. Remove or update code related to Android, Windows, macOS, or other platforms.
- **GitHub Actions Build**: Ensure all code compiles without limitations or disabled features in the CI environment. Remove logic (e.g., `ci_compat`) that disables functionality for CI builds.
- **Error Handling**: Include comprehensive error handling, logging, and recovery mechanisms for stability.
- **Performance Optimization**: Write memory-efficient, CPU-efficient code leveraging iOS-specific APIs (e.g., `mach_task_self`, `vm_allocate`).
- **Lua Interpreter**: Ensure `interpreter.lua` is correctly integrated and fully functional within the executor. Fix setup issues and verify seamless operation.
- **Verification**: Verify that all code compiles and functions as intended in the iOS environment. Install necessary tools to test and ensure the dylib compiles successfully.
- **Dependencies**: Utilize dependencies outlined in `dependencies.txt` for all tasks.

## Task 1: Update Logic in `anti_detection`, `exec`, `hooks`, `memory`, and `security` Folders
**Objective**: Review and update all files in the `anti_detection`, `exec`, `hooks`, `memory`, and `security` folders to ensure production-grade, iOS-specific logic.

**Steps**:
1. **Analyze Existing Code**: Examine every file for placeholders, stubs, incomplete logic, or disabled features (e.g., CI checks, non-iOS platform code). Identify `TODO` comments, empty functions, or conditional compilation.
2. **Implement Robust Logic**:
   - **Anti-Detection**: Implement advanced anti-detection mechanisms (e.g., obfuscate process memory, hook `ptrace`/`sysctl` to evade jailbreak detection, bypass signature verification). Use APIs like `mach_task_self()` for memory manipulation.
   - **Exec**: Ensure the executor core supports full script execution with a robust Lua runtime. Integrate `interpreter.lua` (Task 4) and handle script parsing, execution, and error reporting. Ensure thread-safe execution and memory management.
   - **Hooks**: Implement low-level hooks using Mach-O binary patching or runtime function swizzling to intercept game functions. Handle edge cases (e.g., null pointers, invalid memory access).
   - **Memory**: Provide memory management functions (e.g., read/write process memory, allocate executable memory) using `vm_allocate` and `vm_protect`. Include safeguards against memory corruption and leaks.
   - **Security**: Implement AES-256 encryption for script storage, secure communication, and anti-tampering checks to detect runtime modifications.
3. **Remove Non-iOS Logic**: Eliminate code for Android, Windows, macOS, etc. (e.g., `#ifdef ANDROID`).
4. **Update Compat Files**: Update files like `ci_compat` to remove limitations and enable full functionality in GitHub Actions.
5. **Handle Missing Logic**: Research iOS-specific techniques (e.g., `dlsym` for symbol resolution) to implement missing functionality.

## Task 2: Remove CI and Platform Limitations
**Objective**: Ensure no features are disabled due to CI builds or non-iOS platforms, allowing full functionality in GitHub Actions.

**Steps**:
1. **Identify Limitations**: Search for CI-specific checks (e.g., `ci_compat`, `#ifdef CI`, `getenv("CI")`) or platform-specific disabling (e.g., `#ifndef IOS`).
2. **Update Logic**:
   - Replace CI checks with full implementations (e.g., enable hooks in all environments).
   - Rewrite `ci_compat` files to support full functionality, integrating shims into the main codebase.
   - Ensure all executor features (e.g., script execution, memory manipulation) are enabled for iOS.
3. **iOS-Only Focus**: Remove non-iOS code paths and update build scripts (e.g., Makefile) to target iOS using clang with iOS SDK.
4. **Handle Compat Files**: Ensure `compat` files support full functionality, rewriting for iOS if necessary.

   - **Language Design**: Define a syntax that blends Python and Swift conventions, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
   - **Execution Engine**: Build an engine to parse and execute the custom language, integrating Python (via Python C API) and Swift (via Swift runtime). Use a sandboxed environment for security.
   - **Terminal Integration**: Replace external website-based terminal with an on-device terminal tailored to the app. Use `UIKit` or `SwiftUI` for the UI, supporting code highlighting, autocompletion, and error reporting.
   - **Optimizations**: Ensure efficient memory and CPU usage, leveraging iOS APIs for performance.
   - **Security**: Implement sandboxing and encryption for script storage and execution.

**Steps**:
1. **Identify Terminal Code**: Locate terminal-related code in the codebase and remove external website dependencies.
2. **Implement On-Device Terminal**: Build a custom terminal UI with features like syntax highlighting, command history, and error logs. Use open-source libraries (e.g., CodeMirror-inspired components) for robustness.
