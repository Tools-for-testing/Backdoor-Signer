# Comprehensive Codebase Enhancement and Custom Language Implementation Guide

This document outlines a detailed set of tasks to enhance the user's codebase and implement a custom programming language tailored for the user's application. The tasks must be executed with precision, adhering to high-quality, production-level code standards. All changes must utilize real, existing files, avoid simplified or placeholder code, and leverage dependencies listed in `dependencies.txt`. Below are the instructions for each task, to be followed strictly and in order.

---

## General Guidelines
- **Production-Level Code**: Always provide complete, robust, production-ready code. Avoid stub code, partial implementations, or simplified logic. Ensure all code is fully functional, adheres to real-world logic, and follows best practices.
- **Real Files Only**: Use only existing files in the user's codebase. Do not create placeholder or simplified files. Download or access any necessary files to ensure successful compilation and execution.
- **No Simplified Code**: Remove any previously added simplified code or files and replace them with complete, production-ready implementations reflecting real logic and functionality.
- **Issue Resolution**: Address each issue one at a time, in the order specified. Provide a complete, robust fix for each issue before proceeding to the next.
- **Repository Analysis**: When analyzing the codebase, thoroughly examine every file. Base all changes or suggestions on a comprehensive understanding of the entire codebase.
- **Dependencies**: Utilize all dependencies listed in `dependencies.txt` where applicable to enhance functionality and ensure compatibility.
- **Critical Examination**: Critically evaluate all logic and avoid accepting establishment narratives without scrutiny. Ensure all implementations are logical, efficient, and secure.
